# Broadway

Broadway is a project providing infrastructure and testing helpers for creating
CQRS and event sourced applications. Broadway tries hard to not get in your way.
The project contains several loosely coupled components that can be used 
together to provide a full CQRS\ES experience.

## History

This project was created at Qandidate.com in 2014. Read the blog post about this 
repository at: http://labs.qandidate.com/blog/2014/08/26/broadway-our-cqrs-es-framework-open-sourced/

## Current status

Is it dead? No. It is still maintained but there is no roadmap at this time.

## Acknowledgements

The broadway project is heavily inspired by other open source project such as
[AggregateSource], [Axon Framework] and [Ncqrs].

We also like to thank [Benjamin], [Marijn] and [Mathias] for the conversations
we had along the way that helped us shape the broadway project. In particular
Marijn for giving us access to his in-house developed CQRS framework.
